- __Handling missing values__
- __Handling features__
- __Correlation__
- __The fact about 'reservation status' (decision tree model)__
- __Last arrangements before model comparisons.__

### __3- Models and ROC Curve Comparison__

Not all models have tuning part, the best two models tuned.

- __Logistic Regression__
- __Gaussian Naive Bayes__
- __Support Vector Classification__
- __Decision Tree Model__
- __Random Forest__
- __Model Tuning for Random Forest__
- __XGBoost__
- __Neural Network__
__Model Tuning for Neural Network__
