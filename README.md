__Last arrangements before model comparisons.__

3- Models and ROC Curve Comparison

__Logistic Regression__
__Gaussian Naive Bayes__
__Support Vector Classification__
__Decision Tree Model__
__Random Forest__
__Model Tuning for Random Forest__
__XGBoost__
__Neural Network__
__Model Tuning for Neural Network__
